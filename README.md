# Fibonacci Sequence - Binet Equation

This code calculates a specific term of the Fibonacci Sequence, using the Binet equation. The number of the therm is aksed by the user and a mandatory check is performed, in order for the entered number to be strightly positive and integer. After the check pass, the code returns on the screen the value of the entered term of the Fibonacci Sequence.

## Prerequisites

- Appropriate C++ compiler

- Basic knwoledge of the Fibonacci Sequence

- Knowledge of the Binet Equation

## Usage

- The Binet Equation is used to calculate the value of each term of the Fibonacci Sequence (Fn), without being known the previous two terms of the sequence (Fn-1, Fn-2)

## Compile-Run

Compile source code:

```bash
g++ ./Binet.cpp -o Binet.exe
```

Run the generated executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./Binet.exe
./Binet.exe
```
